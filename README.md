# Delphi SQLite Wrapper

A Delphi wrapper around sqlite3.dll, based on sqlite.h.

(`sqlite.h.txt` is included here to be able to use git's diff and to keep a history of the reference the wrapper is based on;
it's listed as `.txt` to avoid misreporting this project as "C" instead of "Pascal", since there's more of `sqlite.h` than `.pas` files...)
