# Delphi SQLite Wrapper

A Delphi wrapper around sqlite3.dll, based on sqlite.h.

(This project may be misreported under "C" and not "Delphi" because the sqlite.h included here is larger than the total amount of Pascal code!)
(In case you are wondering, sqlite.h is included here to use git's diff and to keep a history of the reference the wrapper is based on.)
